# Mosquitto-mqttx
Mosquitto is an open-source message broker that implements the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. MQTT is a lightweight, publish/subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or where network bandwidth is limited.
